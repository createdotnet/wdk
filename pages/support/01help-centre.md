Email support regarding the WDK can only be answered if it is relating to a malfunction of the WDK system, as our support team can only advise on code that is written or approved by our own developers.

If you spot any problems, you can contact your account manager from your "Help & Support" on the Top Menu from within your Create account.

However, if you get stuck or need some help writing your template, why not head over and ask the community on our [HelpCenter](http://help.create.net/).

You can submit your question in the "WDK area" and members of our community will be able to help you by lending a hand.
