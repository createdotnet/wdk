The Web Designer's Kit (or WDK), is a framework that allows designers to build custom templates to use with Create.

It enables access to a range of features on the Create system to make your template not only have dynamic content, but also user selectable colours, styles, menus, widgets and side columns. You can develop a new template from scratch, or edit a pre-made design making it compatible with our system.

In this documentation, you will be equipped with all the information you need to know to get started with out WDK. Navigate using the left hand menu, pick a tutorial to get started or view the glossary for a complete list of tags.

##Before you get started.

Building a template requires that you have existing knowledge of HTML and CSS. We also recommend that you spend some time familiarising yourself with Create to understand its full capabilities. You can sign up for a [free 30 day trial](http://www.create.net/signup.phtml) to do this.

We cannot offer support on HTML or CSS usage, however there's a designated board on our Create HelpCentre for the WDK where you can submit a question to the Create community to lend a hand. Please see the [Support](pages/support/01how-it-works.html) page for more details.

We do however welcome [feedback](http://www.create.net/contact.phtml?showpage=contactform) on this feature, and how we can improve it for you - so please do [get in touch](http://www.create.net/contact.phtml?showpage=contactform) if you would like to make a suggestion.
