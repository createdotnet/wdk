You can write or insert a pre-written WDK template on to your Create account using our WDK Editor. 
You can also set a thumbnail for it on the template selector on the Design screen.

##Uploading a new Template

To use your WDK template on your Create account, please follow the steps below:

1. Log on to your Create account.
2. Click on "Design"Â  from the Top Menu
3. Click on WDK from the design menu.
4. This will open the WDK editor on the left hand side of the Design screen.
5. Hover over the down arrow icon and select "New Template"
6. Write in your template's name and click " Create Template".

Using the same down arrow, you can open, upload and create additional external files to use with your template.

##Customising the WDK Editor

The WKD editor can then be used to write and amend your template at any time. You can customise the way the editor looks for your code writing preference.

You can customise the following:

Syntax Highlighting. You can chose from a variety of themes with aÂ  great range of colour schemes.
Font Size. Adapt the size of your mark up to suit your preference and screen size.
Line wrapping. Specify if you want your lines to wrap for less scrolling, or stay as they are.
You can make these customisations, simply by opening the editor from your Design screen, and then clicking the "flower" icon from the top right of the editor screen. This will drop down with: theme, font size and line wrapping options.

If you want to close the editor on your Design screen at any time, simply press the 'cross' icon from the top right of the editor screen.

##Template Thumbnail

Once you have created your template, it will appear from the "Templates" drop down on the design screen under "custom". You can upload your own thumbnail for your template that is seen here.

To set your template's thumbnail, simply upload an image file that is named "thumb.jpg" that is a size of 80 x 60 px using the WDK editor external file uploader as mentioned above.
