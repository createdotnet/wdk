Building a template requires that you have existing knowledge of HTML and CSS. We also recommend that you spend some time familiarising yourself with Create to understand its full capabilities. You can sign up for a [free 30 day trial](http://www.create.net/signup.phtml) to do this.

We cannot offer support on HTML or CSS usage, however there's a designated board on our Create HelpCentre for the WDK where you can submit a question to the Create community to lend a hand. Please see the [Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/support.html) page for more details.

We do however welcome [feedback](http://www.create.net/contact.phtml?showpage=contactform) on this feature, and how we can improve it for you - so please do [get in touch](http://www.create.net/contact.phtml?showpage=contactform) if you would like to make a suggestion.
