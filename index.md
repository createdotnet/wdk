The Web Designer’s Kit (or WDK), is a framework that allows designers to build custom templates to use with Create.
It enables access to a range of features on the Create system to make your template not only have dynamic content, but also user selectable colours, styles, menus, widgets and side columns. You can develop a new template from scratch, or edit a pre-made design making it compatible with our system.

In this documentation, you will be equipped with all the information you need to know to get started with our WDK. Navigate using the above menu, pick a tutorial to get started or view the glossary for a complete list of tags.
