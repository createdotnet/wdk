The Web Designerâ€™s Kit (or WDK), is a templating language for making websites on [Create.net](http://www.create.net/)
This documentation aims to help you develop a new template from scratch. Building a template requires that you have existing knowledge of HTML and CSS. A basic understanding of JavaScript will be helpful.

This page documents a complete WDK template and its tags. Hover each tag to find out what it does or copy the example code to get you started on your own site.
