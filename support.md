Email support regarding the WDK can only be answered if it is relating to a malfunction of the WDK system, as our support team can only advise on code that is written or approved by our own developers.

If you spot any problems with the WDK itself, you should refer to the [known issues list](https://github.com/createdotnet/wdk/issues).
